# Vendor Directory

[Find the live site here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to use:

This application is designed to help internal employees find a specific vender, and the invoices associated with them.
In the main directory, you can use the search feature, or sort by vendor name/submission date.
##
Once you've found the vendor, simply click on it, and view all the invoices for that vendor. Each invoice includes all the info, such as the payor, amount, etc. 
##
You can also have a more detailed look at the vendor info in the popup.
